Hello!
This is my Project 2, which is an improved version of a previous project I did last year. 

This page utilises an API to fetch and display data from Europe's top 5 football leagues in form of league tables. You can select which league table you want to view by clicking the logo of the league. The league tables will display the following for each league table: league position, team name, number of matches played, matches won, matches drawn, matches lost, goals scored, goals conceded, goal difference and points. At the bottom of each table there is also an explanation for the colour displayed for some of the teams. These colours are assigned based on league position.

I believe this project meets all the specified application requirements for the project, except for the search string input field.
